## Building

This project can be opened in android studio. You should have the Flutter plugin installed (which depends on the Dart plugin) and have the Flutter SDK working.
While working on this project, you should keep a terminal open in the background and run `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch` in the project's root directory.
This will allow the `built_value` classes to be created or recreated while you work. If you only are making one change, you can simply run `flutter packages pub run build_runner build` instead.
